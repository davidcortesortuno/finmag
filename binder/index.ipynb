    "\n",
    "Finmag is a finite-element micromagnetic simulation tool. For more information, please visit the finmag's [repository](https://github.com/fangohr/finmag) on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation in the form of Jupyter notebooks is available in [doc/ipython_notebooks_src](doc/ipython_notebooks_src) directory. To open one of the tutorials, go to the previous link and select one of the notebooks. More information on how to use Jupyter notebooks can be found on Jupyter [website](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is a working prototype which is not polished, with some (in large parts outdated) attempts at documentation. We do not consider the codebase, documentation, and other content of sufficient quality to encourage uptake in the community. (Experts are welcome!) This is primarily a resource problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to cite\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Finmag in your research, please cite it as\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Zenodo DOI will go here when we make the repository public)\n",
